As suggested by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), here is a list of the things I'm currently doing or thinking about.

## Tao of Tim
The [Tao of Tim](https://t.me/tao_te_tim) is now a Telegram channel! Feel free to subscribe and get a daily show note from The Tim Ferriss Show. Check out [this article](/creations/tao_of_tim.html) for details on how I pieced the project together.

## Learning Polars
Keeping with my trend of writing more Python, I've recently started to dig into the [Polars](https://pola.rs/) library. The ability to use the power of Python with a syntax that is very close to R has been a great way to leverage existing knowledge while learning something new. Plus, it's hard to complain about the more user-friendly method names when compared to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
