As suggested by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now), here is a list of the things I'm currently doing or thinking about.

## MLB Data
My wife and I recently watched [The Clubhouse](https://www.netflix.com/title/81562408) on Netflix and we were blown away by the effort that goes into the 162-game season. One of the questions that came to our minds when watching was, how has the percentage of players from different countries change over time? It's a straightforward data question but will be fun to explore!

## Tinkering with Marimo
Continuing with writing more Python, I've recently been tinkering with [Marimo notebooks](https://marimo.io/). The reproducible execution is interesting and the dataframe viewer seems fairly beneficial as well. I plan to use Marimo to explore the MLB data question above.
