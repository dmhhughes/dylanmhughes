    "text": "I’ve spent a long time thinking about creating a personal website. The idea would bounce around in my mind quite often. Sometimes it would be at the forefront, other times it would be on the back burner. When the motivation and desire for a website prompted me to make more headway, I’d find ways to transfix myself on cosmetic items - colors, logos, layouts, etc. Finally, I was able to overcome these self imposed roadblocks and make a simple site that I believe will serve my needs.\nAt the end of the day, I don’t expect anyone to read what I end up publishing here. The real reason I’m creating this site is to hold myself accountable and to track my progress over time. The overarching goal for this site is to act as an outward facing journal, using the act of writing to refine my overall thinking.\nInitially, I plan to commit to two posts per month - the 1st and 15th. The focus of these posts will be on what I’m currently thinking, learning, and doing. I believe this provides me with ample flexibility to muse on a wide range of topics down to whatever depth I’m interested in.\nI look forward to building this practice and I’m excited to see where I go along the way!"

The first was based on both qualitative and quantitative factors and ultimately was determined by a human. The second was based only on quantitative factors and was evaluated and assigned by a software program. The objective of the analysis was to determine whether ratings were more conservative when assigned by an individual relative to the automated rating.\nI was tempted to use Excel to quickly run through the numbers.

    "text": "Getting Started\nFor the sake of this example, let’s say it’s the end of the year and these ratings are associated with employee reviews. The first, more manual rating, is assigned by an employee’s manager. The manager reviews both the work completed over the year as well as the employee’s attitude, teamwork, and professional development and assigns a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best. The second rating is provided by software the company uses to track work. The program simply reviews the work submitted by the employee and generates a rating, again on a 1 to 5 scale.\nOur example company has 4 employees. Their names and ratings are shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nEmployee\nRating (Manual)\nRating (Auto)\n\n\n\n\nEllie\n5\n3\n\n\nSam\n4\n1\n\n\nRemmy\n4\n2\n\n\nBrandy\n5\n4\n\n\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to determine if there is a conservative bias when assigning ratings manually. But, before we get to interpreting the data, we should pause and consider the optimal data visualization to use to demonstrate our findings."

    "text": "Data-Viz-First Design\nGiven that we have a common categorical variable, our rating scale (1 to 5), and that we want to evaluate the number of observations in each category based on the method of rating, a Clustered Column chart will likely be the most straightforward tool for presenting the data. Ideally, we will want the rating scale to be displayed on the X-axis, the count of observations on the Y-axis, and we will want separate columns for each flavor of rating (manual or auto).\nWe certainly could use Excel to create this chart. And honestly, using Excel would be the easiest option. All we would need to do is highlight our data, go to the “Insert” tab on the ribbon, and in the Charts group, choose “Clustered Column Chart.” Tough to argue with the simplicity of that.\nBut, you never grow if you never push yourself outside of your comfort zone. So, let’s try and tackle this using R."

    "section": "Data Transformation",
    "text": "Data Transformation\nFirst we need to consider the format of our data. Currently, we have a 4 x 3 table with two separate variables containing the data we would like to compare. We know that we need to somehow group the competing ratings together, but we don’t exactly know how to take two variables and turn them into one. This need leads us to the pivot_longer() function.\nAccording to the vignette(\"pivot\"), pivot_longer() increases the number of rows and decrease the number of columns in a dataset. By using pivot_longer(), we are able to re-purpose the individual rating columns in our table, condense them into a single column, and expand the number of rows to still retain the respective ratings.\nTo demonstrate this change visually, take a look at the tables below:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\ndf &lt;- tribble (\n  ~employee, ~rating_manual, ~rating_auto,\n  \"Ellie\", 5, 3,\n  \"Sam\", 4, 1,\n  \"Remmy\", 4, 2,\n  \"Brandy\", 5, 4\n)\n\nkable(df)\n\n\n\n\n\nemployee\nrating_manual\nrating_auto\n\n\n\n\nEllie\n5\n3\n\n\nSam\n4\n1\n\n\nRemmy\n4\n2\n\n\nBrandy\n5\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_longer &lt;- df |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !employee, \n    names_to = \"rating\", \n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )\n\nkable(df_longer)\n\n\n\n\n\nemployee\nrating\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nEllie\nrating_manual\n5\n\n\nEllie\nrating_auto\n3\n\n\nSam\nrating_manual\n4\n\n\nSam\nrating_auto\n1\n\n\nRemmy\nrating_manual\n4\n\n\nRemmy\nrating_auto\n2\n\n\nBrandy\nrating_manual\n5\n\n\nBrandy\nrating_auto\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is great! Now we have a single column for ratings and for values. This makes it much easier to map to the respective aesthetics of ggplot. Let’s give it a go."

Regardless, it was a fun exercise in thinking through the proper data format for those oh-so-often occurring Clustered Column charts in Excel."
